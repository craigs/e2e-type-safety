# End to end type safety

This is a demonstration of how to achieve end to end type safety with ...

- TypeScript
- GraphQL
- React
- NextJS

## GraphQL API

The [GraphQL API](./api/README.md) is developed as NextJS application. Install
dependencies and ensure that it is running locally before running the web layer.

## Web

The front end [web application](./web/README.md) is a NextJS application that
uses Apollo client to talk to our GraphQL API.
